    "### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MongoDB** is a popular open-source NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is designed for scalability, performance, and high availability, making it suitable for modern applications with large volumes of data and complex requirements. MongoDB uses a flexible schema, allowing for dynamic and nested data structures, which is different from traditional relational databases with fixed schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-relational databases**, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that store and manage data in a format other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. They offer a more flexible data model, allowing for schema-less data storage, horizontal scalability, and better performance for certain use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:**\n",
    "1. **Flexible Schema**: When the schema of the data is dynamic and may evolve over time.\n",
    "2. **Scalability**: When scalability and horizontal scaling are essential requirements.\n",
    "3. **Complex Data Structures**: When dealing with nested and hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "4. **Real-time Analytics**: When real-time data analysis and processing are required.\n",
    "5. **High Availability**: When maintaining high availability and fault tolerance is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features of MongoDB:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document-Oriented**: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON), allowing for a flexible schema and nested data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Highly Scalable**: MongoDB is horizontally scalable, allowing for distributed data across multiple servers and automatic sharding to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **High Performance**: MongoDB provides high-speed read and write operations due to its efficient indexing, query optimization, and in-memory processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexible Query Language**: MongoDB supports a powerful query language with features like aggregation, indexing, and full-text search.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Rich Data Model**: MongoDB supports a wide range of data types, including strings, numbers, dates, arrays, and even embedded documents and arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **High Availability**: MongoDB offers built-in replication and failover support, ensuring high availability and data redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Automatic Sharding**: MongoDB automatically distributes data across multiple shards to improve performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Ease of Use**: MongoDB is easy to set up, deploy, and manage, with comprehensive documentation and a vibrant community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB server (default host and port)\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access or create a database\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access or create a collection\n",
    "mycollection = mydb[\"mycollection\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code connects to the MongoDB server running on the default host and port (localhost:27017), accesses or creates a database named \"mydatabase\", and then accesses or creates a collection named \"mycollection\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record, and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "record_one = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\n",
    "result = mycollection.insert_one(record_one)\n",
    "print(\"Inserted record ID:\", result.inserted_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert many records\n",
    "records_many = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 35},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 40}\n",
    "]\n",
    "result = mycollection.insert_many(records_many)\n",
    "print(\"Inserted records IDs:\", result.inserted_ids)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print inserted record using find_one()\n",
    "print(\"Inserted record:\")\n",
    "print(mycollection.find_one({\"_id\": result.inserted_ids[0]}))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print all inserted records using find()\n",
    "print(\"All inserted records:\")\n",
    "for record in mycollection.find():\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `find()` method is used to query documents from a collection in MongoDB. It allows you to specify a query filter to match documents in the collection and returns a cursor object that can be iterated to retrieve the matching documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Using the find() method**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Query documents with age greater than 30\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}}\n",
    "results = mycollection.find(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print matching documents\n",
    "for result in results:\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `find()` method is used to query documents from the collection `mycollection` where the `age` field is greater than 30. The `query` variable specifies the filter condition, and the `results` variable holds the cursor object containing the matching documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sort()` method in MongoDB is used to sort the documents returned by a query. It takes one or more fields and their corresponding sorting order (ascending or descending) as parameters and returns a sorted cursor object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Using the sort() method**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sort documents by age in ascending order\n",
    "results = mycollection.find().sort(\"age\", pymongo.ASCENDING)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print sorted documents\n",
    "for result in results:\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `sort()` method is used to sort the documents returned by the `find()` method in ascending order based on the `age` field. The `pymongo.ASCENDING` constant specifies the sorting order as ascending. You can also use `pymongo.DESCENDING` for descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **delete_one()**: This method is used to delete a single document from a collection that matches the specified filter. It deletes only the first document that matches the filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **delete_many()**: This method is used to delete multiple documents from a collection that match the specified filter. It deletes all documents that match the filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **drop()**: This method is used to drop an entire collection from the database. It permanently removes the collection and all its documents from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are used for data management and cleanup tasks in MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **delete_one()**: When you want to delete specific documents individually from a collection.\n",
    "- **delete_many()**: When you want to delete multiple documents that match certain criteria from a collection.\n",
    "- **drop()**: When you want to remove an entire collection, including all its documents, from the database."
